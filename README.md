Some Xcel Mazes and flood fill out puts and code


As on 7/20/24 I haven't written code

In 2009 I came across the problem..

I have done atomic physics and molecular biology.. I would like a small maze solving knowledge to deliver like real world gmaps to continue academics..

I remember trying flood fill manually long back or even real code but not truncate longest and other things..

So a seperate repo..
