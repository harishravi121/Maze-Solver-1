Some Xcel Mazes and flood fill out puts and code


As on 7/20/24 I haven't written code

In 2009 I came across the problem..

I have done atomic physics and molecular biology.. I would like a small maze solving knowledge to deliver like real world gmaps to continue academics..

I remember trying flood fill manually long back or even real code but not truncate longest and other things..

So a seperate repo..

Don't know what the height of India's mapping computer routing is but some IITs know it..


Travel From S or start to E or exit along shortest path of zeros.. First go along deadends etc but later in 1 try. We need a code to solve it and show output Matrix with 1-100 exact path and a flood fill matrix too
